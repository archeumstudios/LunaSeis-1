# Current status

Last updated: 2026-07-13 (Asia/Kolkata)

## State

Phase 0 feasibility is achieved and Phase 1 is active. The 1,314-event registry and shallow QA are established; nonshallow Batch 1 is fully checksum-verified and locally audited. Batch 1 contributes 648 usable, two questionable, and eight rejected nonshallow events; Batches 2–4 remain pending. No models have been trained and no performance results exist.

## Completed

- Inspected the initial workspace: it was empty and was not a Git repository.
- Preserved the complete supplied handoff in `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- Created the permanent context document set and repository directory skeleton.
- Initialized Git and created commit `2683cd8` (`chore: initialize LunaSeis-1 research repository`).
- Verified waveform bundle `urn:nasa:pds:apollo_pse::1.0`, DOI `10.17189/9ykc-er91`.
- Verified event catalog bundle `urn:nasa:pds:apollo_seismic_event_catalog::1.0`, DOI `10.17189/1520573`.
- Recorded formats, archive layout, timing warning, documented instrument sample rates, and remaining uncertainties in `docs/source_verification.md`.
- Confirmed 47 GiB free before downloading; the catalog required only 2.2 MB.
- Added a manifest-driven catalog downloader and verified all 32 NASA-listed products (2,226,558 bytes) by MD5.
- Audited 11 catalog CSV schemas and generated a machine-readable schema report.
- Inspected the official four-page catalog-description PDF by text extraction and rendered-page review.
- Selected the Apollo 15 S-IVB artificial impact (1971, Julian day 210) as the Phase 0 pilot candidate, with published P arrivals at stations 12 and 14.
- Verified candidate-day availability for S12 and S14 and enumerated all products and official MD5 values.
- Selected MiniSEED plus StationXML/PDS labels: 7,924,909 bytes (about 7.6 MiB), versus over 250 MB for equivalent GeoCSV waveforms.
- Verified product metadata rates: 6.625 Hz mid-period, 53 Hz SHZ, and 1.65625 Hz ATT; corrected the earlier 15 Hz discovery-stage note.
- Documented ATT reception-time semantics, nominal-time drift, uncorrected 1.2-1.4 s Moon-Earth delay, station synchronization risk, and gap sentinels.
- Added and tested a manifest-driven pilot downloader; all 20 products and 7,924,909 planned bytes passed size and NASA MD5 verification.
- Created a Python 3.12 virtual environment with pinned ObsPy/Matplotlib dependencies; pinned setuptools below 81 for ObsPy compatibility.
- Loaded all nine MiniSEED traces and recorded coverage, sample rates, sample counts, full-day sentinels, and event-window sentinels.
- Matched published arrivals through ATT: nominal mapped time is +0.330 s at S12 and +5.233 s at S14 relative to published arrival.
- Generated and visually verified the first unprocessed LunaSeis-1 waveform plot; a strong event signal is visible at both stations.
- Recorded the Phase 0 feasibility result and the scientific limits of this one-event validation.
- Audited NASA science-data, PDS citation, and NASA brand policies; raw PSE observations are operationally treated as CC0, while bulk event-catalog/labeled-derivative republication is deferred pending written PDS clarification.
- Decoded all PDS `T2` event codes, A/B/C grade meanings, quality codes, and station/channel visibility fields from the official XML label.
- Parsed all 13,057 `levent` rows into a local analytical manifest and produced class/year/station/channel counts.
- Found no exact duplicate catalog start-minute keys; identified 319 assigned deep-family IDs and quantified the largest repeating families.
- Defined a conservative A/B pilot pool: 609 deep events, 623 natural impacts, 18 shallow events, and 8 artificial impacts.
- Rejected broad four-class classification for the initial pilot; retained deep-versus-natural-impact only as exploratory secondary work.
- Designed event-disjoint and deep-family-disjoint leave-one-station-out evaluation with chronological validation and no final-station tuning.
- Completed an initial systematic scoping search and extracted ten priority peer-reviewed records plus four screened/background records.
- Established that 2026 FNO work already overlaps lightweight raw-waveform detection/efficiency and that a 2024 short-period catalog expands shallow events from 28 to 74; candidate novelty and labels were revised accordingly.
- Located the authoritative Onodera 2024 article and its 2026 correction; found no separately deposited machine-readable catalog and documented the article tables' CC BY-NC terms.
- Transcribed the corrected tables into a provenance-preserving manifest and reconciled all 28 legacy events exactly to PDS `H` rows; all 46 KO events are absent from the PDS table at the same-minute level.
- Audited 136 event-station pairs: 128 are complete, and every one of the 74 events has at least one complete SHZ+ATT station-day.
- Produced an exact deduplicated plan for 508 PDS products across 127 station-days: 779,909,406 bytes (743.78 MiB / 0.72635 GiB), each with an official expected MD5.
- Kept shallow classification descriptive/exploratory and recorded KO-SMQ-26/KO-SMQ-40 as a repeating pair that must remain split-grouped.
- Downloaded the four KO-SMQ-26 S15 products (7,391,202 bytes) and verified every official MD5 and size.
- Mapped its corrected reference through ATT: nearest ATT is -0.290 s and the associated nominal MiniSEED timestamp is +4.099 s relative to the catalog reference.
- Verified a clear raw emergent SHZ amplitude increase (post/pre RMS 3.56); documented 12.5% isolated one-sample sentinels in the ten-minute SHZ window without interpolating them.
- Downloaded/reused and independently size/MD5-verified all 508 shallow-plan products totaling 779,909,406 bytes.
- Audited all 128 complete event-station windows: 123 usable, one questionable, and four rejected for raw integrity; all 74 events retain at least one usable station.
- Recorded descriptive signal ratios (88 strong, 23 weak, 15 without clear elevation, two unquantifiable) without using them to alter labels or integrity status.
- Combined conservative PDS candidates and corrected shallow events into one 1,314-row physical-event registry without duplicating the 28 overlapping legacy shallow records.
- Preserved source IDs, labels/grades, time precision/semantics, stations/channels, licensing notes, and explicit pending/audited QA status.
- Attached shallow QA, removed four rejected station windows from usable-station fields while retaining all rejected/questionable audit records, and kept all 74 shallow events as candidates with at least one usable station.
- Assigned indivisible physical-event, 115 deep-family, and KO-SMQ-26/KO-SMQ-40 repeating-pair evaluation groups.
- Passed duplicate ID, source ownership, same-minute overlap, cross-class conflict, and legacy PDS-type checks.
- Counted 609 deep, 623 natural-impact, 74 shallow, and eight artificial-impact physical candidates; nonshallow candidates remain pending waveform QA.
- Converted 1,240 nonshallow candidates into 3,071 event-station requests and 2,496 deduplicated/boundary-complete station-days.
- Verified that 1,159 candidates have at least one PDS-backed positive station request; preserved 81 unavailable candidates (57 assigned deep, 24 natural impacts) without relabeling.
- Produced an exact plan for 15,106 MiniSEED/XML products totaling 7,636,136,244 bytes (7.11171 GiB), each with official PDS MD5.
- Partitioned the plan into four deterministic station-day-preserving batches no larger than approximately 2 GiB; no nonshallow waveform data was downloaded.
- Downloaded and exact-size/NASA-MD5 verified all 5,398 Batch 1 products totaling 2,142,346,643 bytes across 845 station-days.
- Hardened the shared downloader to delete and retry completed HTTP responses that fail size/hash checks; no throttled or partial response was accepted.
- Audited 658 events, 842 event-station requests, and 2,234 positive-channel windows with ATT-aware timing and raw gap/extreme-value/RMS metadata.
- Classified 648 Batch 1 events usable, two questionable, and eight rejected on gap/ATT integrity only; visually reviewed the aggregate figure and documented all suspicious cases.
- Updated the unified registry with Batch 1 QA status/stations while preserving every physical label and evaluation group.

- Rebuilt `unified_positive_events.csv` and its SHA-256 audit with Batch 1 outcomes attached.

## Decisions

- The supplied handoff is the canonical stable project context.
- Work begins at Phase 0; modelling remains prohibited until event-to-waveform alignment is verified.
- Treat the PDS event catalog as multiple source tables requiring semantic reconciliation, not an immediately usable flat label file.
- Product metadata, not only instrument-level documentation, will determine actual processing sample rates.
- Use a known artificial impact with two published station arrivals for the first alignment test; this is a feasibility choice, not a final taxonomy choice.
- Use MiniSEED with StationXML and PDS labels for the pilot; include ATT and preserve explicit gaps.
- Treat nominal and ATT-derived timestamps as separate provenance fields; no silent global timing shift.
- Publish code, manifests, aggregate analyses, and models with PDS citations; do not mirror raw archives or catalog-derived labeled datasets before release review/PDS clarification.
- Keep binary detection primary; broad multiclass is unsupported by the initial conservative PDS-only counts.
- Treat physical event and deep-family ID as indivisible split groups, including across stations in LOSO evaluation.
- Use only the 2026-corrected Onodera tables for the 74-event shallow audit; preserve attribution and CC BY-NC constraints.
- Do not promote shallow classification to a headline task; require window QA and group KO-SMQ-26/KO-SMQ-40 together.
- Represent each physical candidate once; merge corrected legacy shallow identities with PDS and never conflate positive visibility with audited waveform integrity.
- Use only positive channels plus ATT for first-pass nonshallow QA, include required midnight boundary days, and download in four bounded station-day batches if authorized.
- Accept the 648 Batch 1 events passing gap/ATT integrity, preserve two as questionable, exclude eight from usable windows, and keep RMS/extreme-value metrics descriptive.

## Unresolved uncertainties

- Exact scalable ATT correction/interpolation policy and catalog-pick time-basis reconciliation remain unresolved.
- The corrected Onodera catalog is integrated, but event-window gap/signal quality and independent confidence for the 46 KO detections remain unaudited.
- Written PDS clarification is still required before publishing catalog CSVs or catalog-derived labeled windows.
- The candidate event's time standard and precise relationship to waveform/timing-trace time remain unresolved.
- Waveform reuse has an operational CC0 basis; catalog and catalog-derived dataset licensing still requires written PDS clarification before republication.
- Full environment portability beyond the tested Apple Silicon Python 3.12 setup remains to be verified later in Colab/Linux.
- No standalone author-deposited Onodera catalog file/checksum was found; the local manifest is a transparent transcription of corrected article tables, not an official machine-readable release.
- Automated integrity QA now covers all 74 events, but morphology/artifact review beyond aggregate metrics remains incomplete.
- The 20%/50% SHZ-gap and 1 s/10 s ATT thresholds are provisional engineering gates requiring sensitivity analysis before protocol freeze.
- Fifteen intact windows lack a clear raw RMS increase and two are unquantifiable; they require review without label demotion or cherry-picking.
- The 1,240 nonshallow candidates have catalog visibility but not the SHZ/ATT window integrity audit completed for shallow events.
- Seven corrected legacy shallow events retain PDS grade C and three are ungraded; their inclusion comes from Onodera provenance and must be handled explicitly in sensitivity analyses.
- The 81 nonshallow candidates without an archive-backed positive request may reflect deployment/archive/visibility inconsistencies and require source-specific review before any permanent exclusion claim.
- Availability for the 582 nonshallow events not covered by Batch 1 does not establish gap-free windows; Batches 2–4 ATT/gap QA remains pending.
- Batch 1 extreme-value occupancy flags possible constant/saturated/quantized windows but lacks a frozen physical clipping rule; it cannot yet drive exclusion.
- Batch 1's two questionable ATT offsets and provisional thresholds require all-batch sensitivity analysis before protocol freeze.

## Exact next task

Download and checksum-verify nonshallow Batch 2 (3,270 products; 2,145,595,149 bytes), then apply the identical event/station/channel ATT-gap audit and attach its outcomes before proceeding to Batch 3.
