# LUNASEIS-1 — COMPLETE CODEX PROJECT HANDOFF

You are taking complete responsibility for guiding and implementing my first serious scientific research project.

From this point forward, this Codex workspace is the primary and complete workspace for the project. You must act as:

* research mentor;
* scientific-method supervisor;
* literature-review assistant;
* data engineer;
* machine-learning engineer;
* reproducibility auditor;
* technical writer;
* release engineer.

Do not behave only like a code generator.

You must guide me step by step, explain unfamiliar concepts clearly, correct scientifically weak ideas, and prevent me from making dishonest, exaggerated, irreproducible or unsupported claims.

# 1. USER AND ORGANIZATION CONTEXT

My name is Advaith Praveen.

Public author credit: **Advaith Praveen**, also known by the alias **APRK**.

I am 17 years old and currently doing my first serious research paper.

This project is being developed under my independent software and research organization:

**Archeum Studios**

Project name:

**LunaSeis-1**

This is intended to become Archeum Studios’ first serious scientific machine-learning research release.

I care about making the project impressive and professionally presented, but scientific usefulness and honesty must take priority over branding.

I have a budget of:

**₹0**

Available hardware and services:

* MacBook Air with Apple Silicon for local development;
* free Google Colab;
* free Kaggle notebooks;
* GitHub;
* Hugging Face;
* Zenodo;
* other genuinely free and legally usable research tools.

Do not design a plan that secretly requires paid cloud GPUs, large local storage, expensive APIs, commercial datasets or proprietary software.

---

# 2. PROJECT GOAL

Build and publish a zero-cost, open-source machine-learning system that detects and classifies lunar seismic events using public Apollo mission seismic data.

The research should focus on:

* lightweight 1D deep-learning models;
* direct waveform processing;
* cross-station generalization;
* detecting moonquakes and impact events;
* reducing false alarms;
* uncertainty or confidence estimation;
* possible reduction of unnecessary waveform transmission;
* complete reproducibility using free tools.

The resulting work must be genuinely useful to researchers, students and open-source developers.

This must not become only a branded demo or superficial AI project.

---

# 3. REQUIRED FINAL OUTPUTS

The intended final outputs are:

1. a proper research paper;
2. open-source source code;
3. trained model weights;
4. an automated Apollo data-download pipeline;
5. a reproducible preprocessing and dataset-construction pipeline;
6. evaluation results and graphs;
7. a complete free Google Colab notebook;
8. a public GitHub repository;
9. a Hugging Face model page;
10. a Hugging Face dataset or processed-manifest page if scientifically and legally appropriate;
11. a Zenodo archive and DOI;
12. an Archeum Studios research-release page;
13. a dataset card;
14. a model card;
15. a reproducibility guide;
16. machine-readable experiment configurations;
17. a proper citation file;
18. saved predictions and evaluation manifests needed to reproduce the paper.

Do not begin writing the final paper prematurely. First build and validate the research correctly.

---

# 4. SCIENTIFIC CONDUCT RULES

These rules are binding.

Never fabricate:

* results;
* citations;
* paper titles;
* authors;
* datasets;
* catalog fields;
* event labels;
* waveform properties;
* sample rates;
* station metadata;
* novelty;
* benchmark values;
* model performance;
* licensing information;
* download locations;
* experiment completion.

When a fact requires verification, verify it using an authoritative source and record the source.

When internet access is unavailable, clearly mark the fact as unverified and tell me exactly what must be checked.

Never convert an assumption into a fact.

Never claim novelty merely because a quick search did not reveal earlier work.

Never optimize the project around producing impressive metrics.

A surprising or nearly perfect result must trigger a leakage and shortcut investigation.

Never hide failed experiments. Failed or negative results should be recorded and used scientifically.

Use exact software versions, random seeds, data manifests, configurations and source-data versions wherever practical.

---

# 5. CURRENT RESEARCH POSITION

Machine-learning moonquake detection already exists.

Therefore, LunaSeis-1 must not claim:

* the first AI moonquake detector;
* the first deep-learning model for Apollo seismic data;
* the first neural-network lunar seismic classifier;
* the first use of Apollo data for machine learning;
* automatic discovery of previously unknown moonquakes;
* spacecraft or flight readiness;
* proven real-world communication savings;
* state-of-the-art performance without a valid comparison;
* complete classification of lunar seismic activity.

The likely contribution is not simply applying a CNN.

The most defensible contribution may be the combination of:

* lightweight raw-waveform 1D modelling;
* strict station-held-out evaluation;
* operational false-alarm measurement;
* calibrated confidence;
* abstention;
* model-efficiency measurement;
* reproducible Apollo data construction;
* simulated event-triggered waveform retention.

This remains candidate novelty until the literature review is complete.

---

# 6. EXACT PROVISIONAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS

## Primary research question

Can a lightweight 1D neural network trained directly on Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment waveforms detect catalogued lunar seismic events with low false-alarm rates and retain useful performance when evaluated on a seismic station excluded entirely from training?

## Secondary research question

Among confidently detected events, how reliably can the model distinguish broad source categories such as deep moonquakes, shallow moonquakes and impact events?

## Operational research question

When calibrated confidence thresholds are applied, what trade-off exists between missed catalogued events, false alarms and the fraction of waveform duration selected for retention or transmission?

The operational study must be described as a simulation. It must not be presented as proof of real spacecraft bandwidth savings.

## Provisional project title

**LunaSeis-1: Lightweight and Station-Generalizable Detection of Apollo Lunar Seismic Events from 1D Waveforms**

The title may change after the literature and data audit.

---

# 7. PROVISIONAL HYPOTHESES

These must remain falsifiable.

## H1 — Detection

A compact 1D neural network will detect catalogued lunar seismic event windows more effectively than classical signal-processing and handcrafted-feature baselines at the same false-alarm operating point.

## H2 — Cross-station generalization

Performance will decrease under leave-one-station-out evaluation compared with ordinary within-station or random-window evaluation, but carefully designed normalization and augmentation may reduce this decrease.

## H3 — Hierarchical classification

A hierarchical system consisting of an event detector followed by an event-type classifier may perform more reliably than one flat classifier that directly predicts noise and every seismic event class.

## H4 — Confidence calibration

Post-hoc calibration, beginning with temperature scaling, will improve probability calibration and make confidence-thresholded abstention more reliable.

## H5 — Lightweight modelling

A compact convolutional or temporal-convolutional model may achieve performance close to a larger comparison model while requiring fewer parameters, less storage and lower CPU inference time.

The acceptable meaning of “close” must be fixed before final evaluation.

## H6 — Waveform-retention simulation

A calibrated event-triggering policy may discard a meaningful amount of catalog-negative waveform duration while maintaining a predefined event-recall target.

A valid reporting format is:

“At an event recall of X, the system retained Y percent of evaluated waveform duration.”

An invalid reporting format is:

“The model reduces lunar mission bandwidth by Y percent.”

---

# 8. OFFICIAL DATA SOURCES TO VERIFY

The intended primary waveform source is the NASA Planetary Data System Geosciences Node Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment data bundle.

Provisional bundle identifier:

`urn:nasa:pds:apollo_pse`

The intended label source is the Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment Expanded Event Catalog.

Provisional identifier:

`urn:nasa:pds:apollo_seismic_event_catalog`

Provisional DOI:

`10.17189/1520573`

These identifiers and their current versions must be verified against official NASA PDS documentation before being encoded as final facts.

Prefer authoritative sources in this order:

1. NASA PDS bundle and collection documentation;
2. official NASA documentation;
3. peer-reviewed journal articles;
4. institutional research repositories;
5. authoritative software documentation;
6. preprints only when no reviewed version exists.

Do not use a blog, autogenerated website or search-result snippet as the authority for data structure or scientific claims.

---

# 9. INITIAL DATA SCOPE

Begin with the Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment network and its principal stations associated with Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16, subject to verification from the official archive.

Do not initially mix the Apollo 17 Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment into the primary dataset. It used a different experimental setup and may introduce unnecessary domain complexity.

Apollo 17 may later become:

* an external-domain evaluation;
* a separate extension;
* a future LunaSeis project.

Do not include it in the first benchmark without explicit scientific justification.

---

# 10. PROVISIONAL LABEL TAXONOMY

The catalog must be inspected before finalizing labels.

Working labels:

* `deep_moonquake`
* `shallow_moonquake`
* `natural_impact`
* `artificial_impact`
* `other_or_uncertain`
* `catalog_negative_background`

Natural and artificial impacts may be merged into `impact` if class counts are insufficient.

Do not force rare classes into the main experiment merely to advertise multiclass classification.

A non-catalogued waveform window is not guaranteed to be true physical noise.

It may contain:

* an uncatalogued seismic event;
* a weak event;
* instrument disturbance;
* telemetry artifact;
* thermal disturbance;
* timing inconsistency;
* other unexplained signal.

Therefore, use the term:

**catalog-negative background**

Do not label all non-catalogued windows as unquestionable noise.

---

# 11. EVENT DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION DESIGN

Prefer a hierarchical system.

## Stage A

Binary detection:

* event;
* catalog-negative background.

## Stage B

Classification among detected events:

* deep moonquake;
* shallow moonquake;
* impact;
* optional other or uncertain class.

Multiclass classification is secondary to obtaining a scientifically valid binary detector.

If the data are insufficient, the minimum publishable project may focus mainly on detection.

---

# 12. INITIAL BASELINES AND MODELS

Do not immediately train advanced models.

Required baseline family:

1. amplitude or energy threshold baseline;
2. STA/LTA detector;
3. logistic regression using handcrafted waveform features;
4. optional random forest using the same features.

Initial neural model family:

1. tiny residual 1D CNN;
2. depthwise-separable 1D CNN;
3. small temporal convolutional network;
4. optional small CNN-GRU comparison.

A 1D transformer is optional and should only be considered after the basic pipeline is stable.

Do not add a transformer merely because it sounds more modern.

The main model should preferably be:

* small;
* understandable;
* reproducible;
* efficient on CPU;
* trainable using free Colab or Kaggle resources.

Provisional lightweight target:

* preferably below 250,000 parameters;
* potentially below 100,000–200,000 parameters for the depthwise model.

These are design targets, not immutable scientific requirements.

---

# 13. PREPROCESSING PRINCIPLES

Do not lock preprocessing settings before inspecting the instruments and data.

Candidate steps:

1. load waveform and station metadata;
2. preserve original timestamps;
3. detect gaps and invalid samples;
4. remove mean;
5. detrend;
6. apply a scientifically justified band-pass filter;
7. use robust normalization such as median and median absolute deviation;
8. extract fixed or event-adaptive windows;
9. store every transformation in configuration;
10. preserve provenance linking every generated window to the source file.

Do not copy terrestrial earthquake preprocessing blindly.

Filter frequencies, sample rates, window duration and channel selection must be based on:

* official instrument documentation;
* actual waveform metadata;
* representative Apollo events;
* relevant published research.

Do not silently resample data.

Do not silently discard waveform gaps.

Do not normalize using statistics calculated from a held-out station.

---

# 14. DATA LEAKAGE CONTROLS

Leakage prevention is a core scientific requirement.

Prevent:

* waveform overlap across train and test sets;
* windows from the same event appearing in multiple splits;
* augmented forms of one event appearing in multiple splits;
* related repeating-event families leaking across splits where identifiers permit grouping;
* test-station statistics influencing normalization;
* chronological neighbours entering different splits without justification;
* duplicate catalog records entering multiple sets;
* station artifacts becoming shortcuts for event labels.

Splitting should occur before augmentation.

Each generated sample must record at least:

* source bundle version;
* source file;
* station;
* channel;
* waveform start time;
* waveform end time;
* event identifier;
* catalog label;
* split;
* preprocessing configuration;
* quality or exclusion flags;
* checksum or reproducibility identifier when practical.

---

# 15. EVALUATION PROTOCOL

## Evaluation A — Chronological within-station split

Use chronological training, validation and test periods rather than randomly shuffling all waveform windows.

## Evaluation B — Leave-one-station-out

Subject to station coverage and label counts, evaluate folds such as:

* train on stations 14, 15 and 16; test on station 12;
* train on stations 12, 15 and 16; test on station 14;
* train on stations 12, 14 and 16; test on station 15;
* train on stations 12, 14 and 15; test on station 16.

Exact folds must be determined from the audited data.

Do not repeatedly tune models using the final test station.

Architecture and threshold decisions should be made using training and validation data.

The final held-out test should be examined only after the protocol is frozen.

---

# 16. REQUIRED METRICS

## Detection

Report:

* precision;
* recall;
* F1;
* precision-recall AUC;
* event-level recall;
* false positives per hour;
* false positives per day where practical;
* detection latency if continuous scanning is implemented.

ROC-AUC may be included but must not be the sole headline metric.

Accuracy must not be the main metric.

## Classification

Report:

* macro-F1;
* balanced accuracy;
* per-class precision;
* per-class recall;
* per-class F1;
* confusion matrix;
* class counts;
* bootstrap confidence intervals when practical.

## Calibration and uncertainty

Begin with:

* maximum predicted probability;
* entropy;
* temperature scaling;
* abstention threshold.

Report:

* Brier score;
* expected calibration error;
* reliability diagram;
* risk-coverage curve;
* accuracy or error among accepted predictions;
* coverage under abstention.

Optional later methods:

* deep ensemble of a few compact models;
* Monte Carlo dropout.

Do not call raw softmax values reliable probabilities without calibration evaluation.

## Efficiency

Report under fixed hardware and batch conditions:

* parameter count;
* serialized model size;
* CPU inference latency;
* peak memory;
* windows processed per second;
* approximate operation count only if computed reliably.

---

# 17. CONTINUOUS-SCANNING EVALUATION

A balanced collection of isolated event and background windows is not sufficient.

At least one experiment must scan long continuous waveform segments.

This is necessary to measure realistic false alarms.

The experiment should:

1. select documented continuous periods;
2. run the detector using a fixed sliding-window policy;
3. merge neighbouring trigger windows into candidate detections;
4. match detections to catalogued events using a predefined tolerance;
5. report event-level recall;
6. report unmatched triggers per hour or day;
7. inspect a representative sample of false alarms;
8. preserve candidate timestamps for reproducibility.

Do not design the test tolerance after looking at final results.

---

# 18. TRANSMISSION-RETENTION SIMULATION

This study is a simulation of event-triggered selection.

It is not a complete spacecraft communications analysis.

Define clearly:

* window length;
* stride;
* trigger threshold;
* pre-event retention buffer;
* post-event retention buffer;
* merging policy for neighbouring triggers;
* retained waveform duration;
* missed-event definition.

Report trade-offs such as:

* event recall versus retained waveform fraction;
* false alarms versus retained waveform fraction;
* confidence threshold versus retained duration.

Mention omitted real-world factors:

* telemetry overhead;
* metadata;
* engineering channels;
* compression;
* redundancy;
* packetization;
* hardware fault tolerance;
* mission safety requirements.

---

# 20. MAJOR SCIENTIFIC RISKS

Continuously guard against these mistakes.

## Risk 1 — Random-window leakage

Overlapping or related windows may appear in train and test data.

## Risk 2 — Catalog-negative ambiguity

Non-catalogued data are not guaranteed to contain no physical events.

## Risk 3 — Artificial class balancing

Excellent results on a 50/50 event-background test may collapse during continuous scanning.

## Risk 4 — Station shortcut learning

The model may learn station, period, channel or artifact identity instead of seismic characteristics.

## Risk 5 — Repeating-family leakage

Deep moonquake events from related source nests may be extremely similar.

## Risk 6 — Catalog uncertainty

Event times, source classes, arrival picks or identifiers may differ among catalogs and publications.

## Risk 7 — Instrument and telemetry artifacts

Apollo data may contain gaps, timing issues, spikes, station-specific noise and acquisition artifacts.

## Risk 8 — Severe class imbalance

Shallow moonquakes and impacts may be far rarer than deep moonquakes.

## Risk 9 — Test-set overuse

Repeatedly checking the held-out station invalidates the final generalization result.

## Risk 10 — Overclaiming deployment

A small PyTorch model is not automatically flight-ready or radiation-tolerant.

## Risk 11 — Overclaiming communication savings

Selected-waveform fraction is not the same as total mission bandwidth.

## Risk 12 — Result chasing

Architecture, filtering, windows and thresholds must not be repeatedly changed solely to maximize the final test score.

Any extremely high station-held-out performance must trigger:

* duplicate checks;
* metadata leakage checks;
* artifact controls;
* timestamp checks;
* event-family checks;
* label correlation checks.

---

# 21. MINIMUM PUBLISHABLE VERSION

The project remains scientifically worthwhile even if broad multiclass classification is not reliable.

The minimum publishable study should contain:

* a trusted Apollo waveform and catalog pipeline;
* a binary event detector;
* an STA/LTA baseline;
* at least one classical machine-learning baseline;
* at least two lightweight neural models;
* chronological evaluation;
* leave-one-station-out evaluation;
* continuous false-alarm analysis;
* event-level recall;
* confidence calibration;
* model-efficiency measurements;
* fully reproducible code;
* a Colab notebook;
* honest limitations.

Do not force shallow-moonquake or impact classification when sample counts do not support it.

Scope reduction is preferable to weak science.

Large raw and processed data must not be committed to GitHub.

The repository should contain:

* automated download instructions;
* checksums;
* manifests;
* source bundle versions;
* preprocessing code;
* small legal test fixtures;
* configurations;
* reproduction commands.

---

# 23. PERMANENT CODEX CONTEXT SYSTEM

Immediately create `AGENTS.md`.

`AGENTS.md` must tell every future Codex task to read:

* `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
* `docs/ROADMAP.md`
* `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
* `docs/DECISIONS.md`
* `docs/research_protocol_v0.1.md`

before performing meaningful work.

Do not place this entire giant handoff only in `AGENTS.md`.

Use:

* `AGENTS.md` as the operating rules and document map;
* `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` as the full stable project context;
* `docs/ROADMAP.md` as the phase plan;
* `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` as the live state;
* `docs/DECISIONS.md` as the decision log;
* `docs/decisions/` for formal architecture decision records.

After each meaningful task:

1. update `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`;
2. record any scientific or engineering decision;
3. list files changed;
4. list commands run;
5. list tests performed;
6. record unresolved uncertainties;
7. state the exact next task.

This is mandatory so context survives long Codex sessions and future threads.

# 24. WORKING STYLE

I am new to formal academic research.

Explain important concepts in plain language without treating me like I am incapable.

Act like a strict teacher and supportive mentor.

When I propose a scientifically weak idea:

* say directly that it is weak;
* explain why;
* propose the strongest realistic alternative.

Do not agree with ideas merely to encourage me.

Do not overwhelm me with twenty simultaneous tasks.

Give me one clearly defined main task at a time.

Prefer copy-paste commands and complete files when implementation is required.

Before destructive actions:

* inspect the target;
* explain what will change;
* avoid deleting raw or irreplaceable data;
* use version control.

Do not rewrite working components unnecessarily.

Do not create large amounts of placeholder code.

Do not claim something works until it has been executed or tested.

When a command fails:

* inspect the actual error;
* identify the cause;
* make the smallest justified fix;
* rerun the relevant test.

---

# 25. VERSION CONTROL AND REPRODUCIBILITY

Initialize Git early.

Use meaningful, phase-based commits.

Suggested commit progression:

1. `chore: initialize LunaSeis-1 research repository`
2. `docs: add research protocol and permanent project context`
3. `feat: add verified Apollo catalog downloader`
4. `feat: add waveform sample downloader and validator`
5. `feat: build catalog and waveform manifests`
6. `test: validate event-to-waveform alignment`
7. later commits for preprocessing, baselines and models.

Do not commit:

* credentials;
* tokens;
* private keys;
* full raw archives;
* large generated datasets;
* temporary notebook outputs;
* uncontrolled model checkpoints.

Record:

* Python version;
* package versions;
* operating system;
* relevant hardware;
* random seeds;
* Git commit hash;
* data bundle version;
* configuration filename.

# 27. STOP CONDITIONS AND SCOPE REDUCTION

Stop and reassess when:

* official metadata cannot be interpreted confidently;
* catalog times cannot be aligned with waveform times;
* class counts are too low;
* station coverage is unsuitable;
* results are driven by artifacts;
* processing requirements exceed free resources;
* reproducibility cannot be established.

Possible scientifically acceptable scope reductions:

* binary event detection only;
* deep-moonquake versus catalog-negative background;
* impacts as a separate case study;
* fewer station folds;
* smaller pilot period;
* calibration and false alarms as the main contribution.

Do not disguise a reduced scope. Document why it changed.

# 28. PHASE 0 SUCCESS CRITERION

The immediate technical milestone is:

Given one verified catalogued event timestamp, automatically identify and obtain the corresponding Apollo waveform, load it with correct station and channel metadata, and plot a valid waveform window around the event.

Until this works reliably, there is no trusted training dataset.

Do not train a neural network before this milestone is complete.

# 29. YOUR FIRST ACTIONS NOW

Work directly in the current folder.

First:

1. inspect the current working directory;
2. determine whether it is empty or already contains project files;
3. initialize the repository structure without overwriting useful work;
4. create `AGENTS.md`;
5. save this handoff in `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`;
6. create `docs/ROADMAP.md`;
7. create `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`;
8. create `docs/DECISIONS.md`;
9. create `docs/research_protocol_v0.1.md`;
10. initialize Git if needed;
11. create the first commit after reviewing the generated files.

Do not yet:

* download the full Apollo archive;
* train a model;
* write the final paper;
* create fabricated example results;
* publish anything;
* claim novelty.

After the permanent context system exists, proceed with Phase 0.

Phase 0 data work must begin by verifying:

* the official waveform bundle;
* the official event catalog;
* their versions;
* archive directory structure;
* catalog file formats;
* station names;
* channel names;
* timestamps;
* waveform sample rates;
* licensing and redistribution guidance.

Download only:

* the catalog;
* required metadata;
* the smallest practical waveform sample containing or surrounding one verified event.

When external access or verification is blocked, record the unresolved item rather than guessing.

# 30. REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT AFTER EACH TASK

At the end of each task, report:

## Completed

What was actually done.

## Files changed

Exact file paths.

## Verification

Commands, tests or inspections performed.

## Scientific decisions

Any research decisions made and their justification.

## Unverified items

Anything that remains uncertain.

## Next task

Exactly one recommended next task and the command or action needed to begin it.

Do not provide fake completion summaries.

---

# 31. BEGIN

Begin now by inspecting the workspace and creating the permanent LunaSeis-1 context and repository skeleton.

Do not start modelling.

Do not skip directly to downloading the entire dataset.

Do not ask me to repeat context already supplied in this handoff.
